Bits to Silicon: My SoC Labs Story
# VSD SoC Labs Journey

This repository tracks my SoC Labs work from Week 0 onwards: tool installation, learning, mistakes, and growth.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To record each week’s tasks, results, and learning.
- To keep everything reproducible: screenshots, logs, scripts, designs.
- To look back later and see what I struggled with, what I nailed.
