***Bits to Silicon: My SoC Labs Story***

# VSD SoC Labs Journey

This repository is the record of my **SoC Labs journey**.  
It starts from Week 0 and moves forward step by step — setting up the environment, learning new concepts, facing mistakes, and growing through every challenge.  

Each week adds a new layer to the journey, taking me closer from **the very first bit of code to working silicon**.

---

### 🎯 Purpose

- To record each week’s tasks, results, and learning.
- To keep everything reproducible: screenshots, logs, scripts, designs.
- To look back later and see what I struggled with, what I nailed.
